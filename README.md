# learngl
This is my attempt to learn some OpenGL basics. My personal goal with this is to be able to understand how Vulkan works, and why it is better. And to later use some of these skills to make some cool visualizations in Unity or Unreal. To follow along, see the resources I have compiled below and the order I intend to learn these things:

1. [Learn OpenGL](https://learnopengl.com/),
2. [The Book of Shaders](https://thebookofshaders.com/00/),
3. [How to learn Vulkan](https://www.jeremyong.com/c++/vulkan/graphics/rendering/2018/03/26/how-to-learn-vulkan/).

I will attempt to compile a review of these resources at the very end, and document what I have learned.
